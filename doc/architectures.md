# Bass Architectures
Most compilers can compile code to every target platform by using different backends. Bass is no exception to this, but it offers the possibility to write an custom backend in minutes and by just using an text editor.

> **Note:**<br/>
> Speaking of architecture-files usually refers to string files used by the Table-Architecture-Backend.

## Using and writing Architecture Tables
Architecture files are simply text files that have one instruction in each line. This could be an command, an comment, or an token pair. Let's be honest, we read this document because we want to know more about the token pair.

Our syntax is simple: The left side represents what you see in the assembly file, the right side is the result that you want to see as binary output.

```cpp
// <LFH> ;<RHS>
// WDC6502
nop        ;$ea
asl #*08   ;*a:$0a
```
> Please keep in mind to always use **lower** case.

The example is straight forward: `nop` is translated to the value `0xEA` and will be put into the current position of the output binary.

### LFH Tokens
Bass always tries to give as least limitations to architecture files as possible. The LFH syntax only know two reserved states:

* The first character is an `#`, because this indicates defines or command calls
* `*` indicate parameters and how many bit's are used.

```cpp
// WDC6502
nop            ;$ea
cmp #*08       ;$c9 =a
cmp (*08,x)    ;$c1 =a
cmp (*08),y    ;$d1 =a
cmp *16,y      ;$d9 =a
cmp *16,x      ;$dd =a
cmp *08,x      ;$d5 =a
cmp *16        ;$cd =a
cmp *08        ;$c5 =a
```

This compare's come in a lot of syntax flavor's, huh? But this is it. It's just a flavor. The only functional stuff on the left side indicates that we have `08` and `16` bit parameters. And thats allready the whole syntax: Alot of fancy ASCII plus some pointers what of it is actually interesting for us.

Remember that bass is alway working top down. On the assemply Stage we will scan top down, until the first matching line. Everything behind this line will be ignored.


### RHS Tokens
On the right side we will find out construction rule. They contain constants, parameters and instruction tokens that tell our compiler what to do with it. Lets go back to our example.

```cpp
// WDC6502
nop            ;$ea
cmp *16,x      ;$dd =a
cmp *08,x      ;$d5 =a
cmp *16        ;$cd =a
cmp *08        ;$c5 =a
```
`nop` -> constant value `0xEA`.

`cmp *16,x` -> constant value `0xDD` followed by the two bytes of the first parameter. Parameters will always have increasing letters starting at `a` from the left to the right. `=` indicates that we *strong* expect `a` to be an 16-Bit value. If not, this line will not match.

`cmp *08,x` -> constant value `0xDD` followed by that bytes of the first parameter. Again we expect a perfect match in terms of the used bit's.

Since the scanner works top down it is important to know when to demand exact `!`, strong `=` or weak `~` fitting values. On this architecture we would never reach the second line 

```cpp
cmp *16        ;$cd ~a
cmp *08        ;$c5 =a
```
Because an 8-Bit value would always fit into an 16-Bit-or-less parameter as we indicate it here.

> **Note:**<br>
> The following list is under construction.

Code | Descr | Example
--- | --- | ---
`$` | hex constant | `nop ;$ea`
`%` | binary constant | `nop ;%1110 %1010`
`!` | exact value required | `cmp *16  ;$cd !a` needs exact 16 bit param
`=` | strict value required | `cmp *16 ;$cd =a`
`~` | weak value required | `cmp *16 ;$cd ~a`
`+` | foo | `todo`
`-` | foo | `todo`
`*` | foo | `todo`
`>>` | foo | `todo`
`<<` | foo | `todo`
`+>>` | foo | `todo`
`N>>` | foo | `todo`
`N` | foo | `todo`



### Commands
Commands can and should be used to set the assembler into the right operation state. 

Each architecture description that is not calling `#endian` and `#directive` on it's first rows can be considered as dangerous. Autors should never expect the users to not mix different architecture files so wild that they destroy any kind of 'default behavior'.

#### `#directive <name> <bytesize>` 
Defines that the directive `name` will have exactly THIS `<bytesize>`. 

Default values are:
```cpp
{"db", 1}, {"dw", 2}, {"dl", 3}, {"dd", 4}, {"dq", 8}
```
> **Note:**<br/>
> If you mix different architectures back and forth it might be that architecture `b` is setting custom directives, but `a` is not. This means that `b` changes the sizes, and `a` do not change them back. This leads to an very stupid error that is hard to track. Whenever you write an custom architecture make sure, to set the directives!

#### `#endian msb` and `#endian lsb`
Set the current architecture to be big or little endian.

#### `#include <path/name>`
Includes the full content of `<path/name>.arch` file into the current one

## Custom Backends
Tables have two big flaws

* They are not as fast as real code since alot of string compares are used for each Instruction. Compiling huge projects can and will be slow
* They are dumb. Complex architectures and nested register features result to large architecture files, since there is no way to handle them in a smarter way.

But there is a solution for both: Extend the bass source code and handle some the whole compiling, or just parts of it using custom c++ routines.

### The architecture Interface
`todo`

### Add an hardcoded backend
Given your new Architecture is called `foo` and you want to add it into bass just follow this steps:

**1.** Create a the new subfolder for your Architecture like `bass/architecture/foo/`

**2.** Create `foo.hpp` in your new folder and fill it with an minimalistic struct like 
```cpp
struct Foo : Architecture {
  Foo(Bass& self);
  
  // called on each assemply line:
  auto assemble(const string& statement) -> bool override;
};
```
You may extend the constructor as much as you need, but there should be no reason to do so.

**3.** Now create the `foo.cpp` besides of the header and also fill it with some minimalistic implementation details:
```cpp
Foo::Foo(Bass& self) : Architecture(self) { }

auto Foo::assemble(const string& statement) -> bool {
  print(statement, "\n");
  return true;
}
```
The `assemble` command will be called for each assembly line thats need an binary output. This lines will allready represent the static output after macro features and everything else are done with working.

`TODO: more?`


**4.** Include `foo.hpp` in the main `bass.hpp`, and `foo.cpp` at the `bass.cpp`

**5.** Add the usage of your code inside of the `assemble.cpp` file, somewhere around line 90.
```cpp
if(s == "none") architecture = new Architecture{*this};
  // <--- here!
else {
  architecture = new Table{*this, readArchitecture(s)};
}
```

**6.** Notice that implementing an full assembler from scratch is too much work, and use the 'extend' approach instead.


### Extend the Table Backend
`todo` As above. But you Extend the original `table` class and pass everything though it that is not of your concerns.
