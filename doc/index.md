**This is for you if:**
  * you want or need to work low level 
  * dependencies are something that you want to avoid
  * the system is so obscure that you cant find any other compiler but dont want to write your own
  * you like to have strong macro features that allow you to work as if you almost have a higher programming language
  * if something dont work, you want to be able to fix it

**This is not for you if:**
  * you look for a higher 'real' programming language
  * you expect an complete toolchain that takes care about all of your needs
