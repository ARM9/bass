bug in: error "string"
test case:
error "foo"
$ bass err.asm
error: foo
e.asm:2:1: error "foo"
bass: assembly failed
rationale: Should list the line where the macro was invoked? instead of the line in the macro where the error statement is located.

lda #$00		= A9 00
lda #$0000		= A9 00 00
lda #0			= A9 00 00
lda #00			= A9 00 00
lda #%00000000	= A9 00
lda #$0			= error: malformed expression
lda #$1			= error: malformed expression
lda #$01		= A9 01
lda #$001		= error: malformed expression
