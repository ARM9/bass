Problem:

dli t,const => : bass >>56, >>48, >>40, >>32 needs to work, right now it only works on 32-bit immediate
  # biggest case:
  lui t,const63..48
  ori t,const47..32
  dsll t,16
  ori t,const31..16
  dsll t,16
  ori t,const15..0

----------------------------------------------------
Changes:

dmul d,s,t => : Changed to use dmult s,t instead of dmultu
  dmultu s,t ---> dmult s,t
  mflo d

dmulu d,s,t => : New pseudo op for dmultu
  dmultu s,t
  mflo d

li t,const => : bass can't do something differnt for size of immediate so li always loads 32-bits

lli t,const => : New pseudo op to only load 16-bits to lower (Load Lower Immediate)

----------------------------------------------------
Weirdness:

bleu/bleul is the same as ble/blel
