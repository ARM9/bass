# bass

bass is a table-based, multi-architecture and cross-platform, macro assembler developed by Near up until version 17. It is targeted at developers and hackers interested in legacy video game consoles such as the NES, SNES, MegaDrive and others.

**bass is for you if:**
  * you want or need to work low level
  * you want to avoid dependencies
  * you target obscure systems that lack any other compiler
  * you want to build your own compiler
  * you want extensive macro features giving you the convenience of a higher-level programming language
  * you want the ability to do root level debugging
  * 
**This is not for you if:**
  * you look for a higher 'real' programming language
  * you expect an complete toolchain that takes care about all your needs
